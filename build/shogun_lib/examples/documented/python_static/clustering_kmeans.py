# In this example the k-means clustering method is used to cluster a given toy
# data set. In k-means clustering one tries to partition n observations into k
# clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
# The algorithm class constructor takes the number of clusters and a distance to
# be used as input. The distance used in this example is Euclidean distance.
# After training one can fetch the result of clustering by obtaining the cluster
# centers and their radiuses.

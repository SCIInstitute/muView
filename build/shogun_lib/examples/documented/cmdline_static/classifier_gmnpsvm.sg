% In this example a multi-class support vector machine is trained on a toy data
% set and the trained classifier is used to predict labels of test examples. 
% The training algorithm is based on BSVM formulation (L2-soft margin
% and the bias added to the objective function) which is solved by the Improved
% Mitchell-Demyanov-Malozemov algorithm. The training algorithm uses the Gaussian
% kernel of width 2.1 and the regularization constant C=1.2. The bias term of the
% classification rule is not used. The solver stops if the relative duality gap
% falls below 1e-5 and it uses 10MB for kernel cache.
% 
% For more details on the used SVM solver see

# In this example we show how to perform Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL)
# with the modular interface for multi-class classification. 
# First, we create a number of base kernels and features.
# These kernels can capture different views of the same features, or actually
# consider entirely different features associated with the same example 
# (e.g. DNA sequences = strings AND gene expression data = real values of the same tissue sample). 
# The base kernels are then subsequently added to a CombinedKernel, which
# contains a weight for each kernel and encapsulates the base kernels
# from the training procedure. When the CombinedKernel between two examples is
# evaluated it computes the corresponding linear combination of kernels according to their weights.
# We then show how to create an MKLMultiClass classifier that trains an SVM and learns the optimal
# weighting of kernels (w.r.t. a given norm q) at the same time. The main difference to the binary
# classification version of MKL is that we can use more than two values as labels, when training
# the classifier.
# Finally, the example shows how to classify with a trained MKLMultiClass classifier.

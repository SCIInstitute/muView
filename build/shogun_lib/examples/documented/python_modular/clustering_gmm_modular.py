# In this example the GMM clustering method is used to cluster a generated
# data set. In GMM clustering one tries to partition n observations into k
# clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster defined by a Gaussian
# distribution, whose probability of generating the observation is highest.
# The algorithm class constructor takes the number of clusters and a type of
# covariance as input. The covariance used in this example is the full covariance.
# The training method used in this example is Expectation-Maximization. It takes
# minimum covariance, maximum iterations and minimum log-likelihood change as
# input. After training one can cluster observations by selecting the most
# likely cluster to have generated the observation.

# In this example a two-class linear support vector machine classifier is trained
# on a toy data set and the trained classifier is used to predict labels of test
# examples. As training algorithm the steepest descent subgradient algorithm is
# used. The SVM regularization parameter is set to C=0.9 and the bias in the
# classification rule is switched off. The solver iterates until it finds an
# epsilon-precise solution (epsilon=1e-3) or the maximal training time
# max_train_time=1 (seconds) is exceeded. The unbiased linear rule is trained.
# 
# Note that this solver often does not converges because the steepest descent
# subgradient algorithm is oversensitive to rounding errors. Note also that this
# is an unpublished work which was predecessor of the OCAS solver (see
# classifier_svmocas).
